++ List View

\ListView
\ExpandableListView 

Adapters are not only used by \ListView, but also by other views which extend \AdapterView as, for example, Spinner, \GridView, Gallery and \StackView.

+++ Filtering and sorting
how is filtering implemented in phonebook?

+++ Empty view
android:id="@android:id/empty"

+++ Performance issue
 * time consuming operations
    layout inflating, java object creation, findViewById
 * effective way
    \ViewHolder

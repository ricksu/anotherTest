++ Context

+++ What are contexts, when to use app context and activity context ?

1.Context contains information of current application, including device screen infos, 
themes etc.
There is possibility that application and activity use different themes,
so normally activity context should be used.

2.The Application Context is typically used when singleton instances need to be created, such as a custom manager class that requires Context information to gain access to system services but gets reused across multiple Activities. Since retaining a reference to the Activity context would cause memory not to be reclaimed after it is no long running, it's important to use the Application Context instead.

Memory leak example:
Manager singleton class, use context to retain, activity will not be GCed if the activity's context is held by the manager class.

Hi Su-san, 

 

I executed the below command to upload deb package to protected C2D server.

 

$ repository addpackage app-phonebook_19.1.A.0.0-VOLATILE-PRE-M-KITAKAMI-150924-1916.deb -ru http://androidswrepo-protected.sonyericsson.net

Package is in the repository: app-phonebook:19.1.A.0.0-VOLATILE-PRE-M-KITAKAMI-150924-1916:semc:all

 

I saw the uploading succeeded by finding the deb package.

http://androidswrepo-protected.sonyericsson.net/pool/semc/a/app-phonebook/

 

Next step is updating variant spec. Please go ahead.

Hi Su-san,

 

(1)   I’ll get back to you after I get how to upload it. Unitl then, please build other debian packages.

(2)   local-contacts version was changed 17 to 18 when l cookie update. So, this time changing to 19.0.A.0.0 is good.

Please also follow the past conventions for other components.

(3)   Yes, runtime permission will be implemented by Tokyo side after you finishes the delivery.

Hi Yokoyama-san,

 

some questions now,

(1) phonebook debian package is created at 

http://android-ci-protected.sonyericsson.net/view/All/job/Application_official_build_with_Gradle/

 

then how to upload it Protected C2D manually ?

 

(2) Other phonebook components lick local-contacts, are using master branch now, what tags should be set ?

Take local-contacts as example, currecnt tag is 18.0.A.0.8, so we should set new tag as 18.0.A.0.10 ?

 

(3) Components like smart-search, local-contacts, video-calling-account etc, all need user to grant permissions manually,

or there will be crashes.

I think these permission issues need to be handled later, not in this delivery, right ?

 

BRs
